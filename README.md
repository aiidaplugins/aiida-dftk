# AiiDA-DFTK Plugin

## Overview

This is an [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) plugin for [DFTK](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/), providing support from the AiiDA side to integrate DFTK seamlessly.

**Note:** For complete integration of DFTK with the AiiDA ecosystem, the [AiidaDFTK](https://github.com/mfherbst/AiidaDFTK.jl) plugin is also required for the Julia side. A comprehensive guide for the [set-up](docs/source/1%20Set-up.md) is provided.

## Documentation

There are four documentation files available to guide you through the setup and usage of the AiiDA-DFTK plugin:

1. [**Set-up:**](docs/source/1%20Set-up.md) Learn how to set up the AiiDA-DFTK plugin.
2. [**First Calculation:**](docs/source/2%20First%20Calculation.md) Discover how to run a DFTK calculation using AiiDA.
3. [**First Workchain:**](docs/source/3%20First%20Wrokchain.md) Understand how to run a DFTK calculation using AiiDA's DftkBaseWorkchain.
4. [**First Common Workflow:**](docs/source/4%20First%20Common%20Workflow.md) Explore how to run a DFTK calculation using AiiDA's common workflow.

All documentation files are located in the [`aiida-dftk/docs/source/`](docs/source/) directory of the repository.
