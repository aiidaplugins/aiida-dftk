# AiiDA-DFTK Plugin

## Overview

This is an [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net/) plugin
for [DFTK](https://docs.dftk.org/stable/),
providing support from the AiiDA side to integrate DFTK seamlessly.

**Note:** For complete integration of DFTK with the AiiDA ecosystem,
the [AiidaDFTK](https://github.com/epfl-matmat/AiidaDFTK.jl) plugin
is also required for the Julia side.
See the [setup documentation](docs/source/1-setup.md).

## Documentation

and usage of the AiiDA-DFTK plugin:
